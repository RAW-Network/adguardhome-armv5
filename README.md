# AdGuardHome ARMv5 Container (MikroTik hEX / Legacy Routers)

**AdGuardHome container image for ARMv5 devices**, designed specifically for legacy routers such as:

✅ MikroTik hEX (EN7562CT CPU)

✅ Other ARMv5-only container environments

Official AdGuardHome images do **not support ARMv5**, which prevents them from running on certain MikroTik devices.
This repository solves that limitation by providing a working, lightweight container build.
