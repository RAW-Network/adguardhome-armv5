# About

This project was created to provide a fully working **AdGuardHome container for legacy routers**, specifically **MikroTik hEX (ARMv5 / EN7562CT CPU)**.

According to MikroTik documentation, this device is limited to running **ARMv5 containers only**. Because of this, the official AdGuardHome images cannot run on hEX refresh.

This repository builds a **minimal, optimized ARMv5 AdGuardHome image** using a multi-stage Dockerfile. The AdGuardHome binary is pulled from the official GitHub releases, extracted in the builder stage, and packaged into a lightweight runtime image suitable for MikroTik devices.

# Registry Information

This image is published on **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.

Set your MikroTik container registry to:

```
https://ghcr.io
```

Then pull the image from:

```
raw-network/adguardhome-armv5:latest
```
